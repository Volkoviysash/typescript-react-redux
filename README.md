<h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>
In this application, I learned how to make queries, users can get data from the server, and they are displayed in the application. The first block function displays the tasks from the to-do list. There is another block with users that also receives data asynchronously from the server. Overall, this app seems like a valuable resource for those who want to learn more about async actions. In this project, I emphasized functionality over design, so it may seem boring.
